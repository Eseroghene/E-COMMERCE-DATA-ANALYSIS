	•	Delivery and Sales Relationship: Assess the impact of delivery status (on-time, delayed, canceled) on sales and customer satisfaction.
	•	Shipping Type vs. Delivery Performance: Investigate the effect of different shipping methods on delivery performance.
	•	Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on behavior, preferences, and demographics to identify the most engaged segments.

 **DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS**
Historical Sales Trend
	•	Explosive Growth (2019-2022): Revenue surged, likely driven by new products, marketing, or demand.
	•	Sharp Decline in 2023: Revenue dropped, possibly due to increased competition, economic factors, or marketing inefficiency.

Geographical Performance
	•	Revenue: West region has the highest with $16.7M, while South has the lowest at $8.4M. There’s a decline from West to South.
	•	A.O.V.: West region has the highest at 433.2, and South the lowest at 425.2. A.O.V decreases similarly to revenue.
	•	Correlation: Higher revenue is linked to higher A.O.V, showing a possible cause of high sales in the West region.

 Delivery ans Sales Relationship By Regions
   . Late Delivery: Despite late deliveries, sales revenue across all regions remains high with the West region leading,suggesting that customers are 
     primarily satisfied with the product quality and are willing to overlook the delivery delays

     faster delivery, followed by the East, South, and Central 
   . On-Time Delivery:The East region demonstrates the highest revenue, suggesting a strong focus on timely delivery and potentially higher customer 
     satisfaction. The Central region has the lowest revenue, indicating potential challenges in meeting delivery deadlines.

Customer Segmentation
 	•	Consumer Segment: Dominates both in quantity and revenue, showing the highest interest in products and driving overall sales.
	•	Corporate Segment: Makes a strong contribution to revenue.
	•	Home Office & Home Segments: Smaller but still significant, with growth potential in these areas.
