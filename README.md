 ## DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS
 
  **Historical Sales Trend**
	
	•	Explosive Growth (2019-2022): Revenue surged, likely driven by new products, marketing, or demand.
	•	Sharp Decline in 2023: Revenue dropped, possibly due to increased competition, economic factors, or marketing inefficiency.
 
  **Top Performing Categories**
	
 	•	Office Supplies is the top performer and leads with $31 million, contributing the most to revenue.
	•	Furniture follows with $11 million in revenue.
	•	Technology generates the least, with $9 million in revenue.
 
**Customer Retention and Loyalty**

	•	Returning Customers: Represent 58.42% (42K), indicating strong customer retention and loyalty.
	•	The 65.3% retention rate supports the idea of strong customer loyalty.

 **Shipping Type Vs Delivery Performance**
 
 	•	First Class: Most reliable with the highest on-time delivery rate and lowest late delivery rate.
	•	Same Day Shipping: Fast but struggles with on-time performance, with 45.65% of deliveries being late.
	•	Standard Class: Least reliable, with 38.31% late deliveries and 20.70% advance shipments.
	•	Cancellation Rates: Generally low across all shipping types, with late deliveries being a bigger concern.

**Geographical Performance**

	 •	Revenue: West region has the highest with $16.7M, while South has the lowest at $8.4M. There’s a decline from West to South.
	 •	A.O.V.: West region has the highest at 433.2, and South the lowest at 425.2. A.O.V decreases similarly to revenue.
	 •	Correlation: Higher revenue is linked to higher A.O.V, showing a possible cause of high sales in the West region.

 **Delivery Vs Sales Relationship By Regions**
 
    •	Late Delivery: Despite late deliveries, sales revenue across all regions remains high, with the West region leading. This suggests that customers 
      are primarily satisfied with product quality and are willing to overlook delivery delays.
	  •	Advance Shipping: The sales impact of advance shipping varies significantly across regions. The West region demonstrates the highest demand for 
      faster delivery, followed by the East, South, and Central regions.
	  •	On-Time Delivery: The East region demonstrates the highest revenue, suggesting a strong focus on timely delivery and potentially higher customer 
      satisfaction. The Central region has the lowest revenue, indicating potential challenges in meeting delivery deadlines.
		
**Customer Segmentation**

 	•	Consumer Segment: Dominates both in quantity and revenue, showing the highest interest in products and driving overall sales.
	•	Corporate Segment: Makes a strong contribution to revenue.
	•	Home Office & Home Segments: Smaller but still significant, with growth potential in these areas.
